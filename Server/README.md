The server for my web application.

The node.js modules folder will not be included in the submission for the client or server as they are very large folders. If you would like to see the contents, running the “npm install” command while inside the client or server directory will install the node.js modules folder.

My Spotify API key, Spotify client ID and Cloud Database keys have been anonymised as agreed with my supervisor.
